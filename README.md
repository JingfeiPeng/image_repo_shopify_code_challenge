source .venv/bin/activate # or on windows: source .venv/Scripts/Activate 
# Install package and dependencies
pip install .
```

Start server:
```
python server/server.py --reset
```
Use `client/post_client.py` for uploading images and `client/get_images_client.py` for fetching images. 
See `Architecture` below for avaliable options and `Sample Usage` for examples on how to use

Tested on Ubuntu and Windows
### Tests:
To run tests: `./run_tests.sh`

## Architecture

### Server:

    - Manages a directory as file storage for all image files
    - Handles incoming POST API calls to store image
    - Uses SQL to store image meta data and user
    - Have User table to protect access to images
    - options:
        --port: Port the server will run on
        --reset: if set, resets the sql database and clears file storage
        --storage_dir: path to the directory for image storage
        --database: database file

### Client scripts:

    post_client.py:
    - Client script to send POST request with body as the image to server
    - Uses Async to allow large amount of API calls
    - Uses configurable semaphora to avoid making infinity amount of API call at once
    - Options:
        --dir: a directory path, defaults to sample_images
        --file: individual file path
        --private: set all images uploaded by the script to be private, default is public where anyone can access. Private images would only be searchable by the user that uploaded them
        --description: description for all images that are about to be uploaded by the script. To have different description for images. Use the script multiple times
        --user: the user that is uploading the images, defaults to root user
    
    get_images_client.py:
    - Client script to get a list of all avaliable images in the image repo and their meta data
    - Options:
        --user: get images for specified user. This will get all public images and private images for specified user
        --keywords: search images based on keyword. This will find all images with title containing keyword or description containing keyword


### Database:
    - Uses a SQL table for storing image meta_data
    User table:
     account: String
    
    Currently there is no user authenication, to have user authenication, I would store encrypted password in User table and have a login api for giving JWT token if successfully login,
    subsequent requests for storing images will pass the JWT token where other APIs can get user account
    from the token

    Image table:
        title: str, the image file name when the image was sent to the server
        path: str, Primary key, the actual image file name that is stored in `storage`, the file name is a uuid.uuid4() random string generated by the server to guarantee the stored file names are unique 
        description: str
        permission: 'PUBLIC' or 'PRIVATE'
        owner: str
        owner references account in User

## Sample Usage

Upload files:
```
python client/post_client.py \
    --file client/sample_images/cat_1.jpg \
    --file client/sample_images2/cat_copied.jpg
```

Upload folders:
```
python client/post_client.py \
    --dir client/sample_images/ \
    --dir client/sample_images2/ 
```

Or combination:
```
python client/post_client.py \
    --file client/sample_images/cat_1.jpg \
    --dir client/sample_images2/
```

### Public and private images

Terminal 1
```
# reset server
python server/server.py --reset
```

Terminal 2
```
# upload private images
python client/post_client.py --user=jeff --private
# upload some public images
python client/post_client.py --user=jeff --dir client/sample_images2/ 
# get images, will only show public images avaliable to root user (images in sample_images2)
python client/get_images_client.py
```

### Search images by keyword
Terminal 1
```
# reset server
python server/server.py --reset
```

Terminal 2
```
# upload private images
python client/post_client.py --user=jeff --dir client/sample_images2/ --private
# upload some public images
python client/post_client.py --user=jeff
# get images, will only show public images avaliable to root user and images containing keyword cat
python client/get_images_client.py --keyword=cat
```
